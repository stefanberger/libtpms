CHANGES - changes for libtpms

version 0.7.12:
 - tpm2: Fix potential out-of-bound access & abort due to HMAC signing issue (CVE-2025-49133)
 - tpm2: Check size of buffer before accessing it (CVE-2023-1017 & -1018)
 - tpm2: Do not call EVP_PKEY_CTX_set0_rsa_oaep_label() for label of size 0 (OSSL 3)
 - tpm2: Return TPM_RC_VALUE upon decryption failure
 - tpm2: Fix the returned number in the JSON
 - tpm12: Replace include of engine.h with err.h

version 0.7.11:
 - tpm2: Do not set RSA_FLAG_NO_BLINDING on RSA keys anymore
 - tpm2: Fix a potential overflow expression (coverity)
 - tpm2: Fix size check in CryptSecretDecrypt
 - tpm2: Check return code of BN_div()
 - tpm2: Do not write permanent state if only clock changed

version 0.7.10:
 - tpm2: Marshal event sequence objects' hash state
 - tpm2: Fixes for building and running with OpenSSL 3.0

version 0.7.9
 - tpm2: NVMarshal: Handle index orderly RAM without 0-sized terminating node
 - tpm2: Initialize a whole OBJECT before using it

version 0.7.8
 - tpm2: Reset too large size indicators in TPM2B to avoid access beyond buffer
 - tpm2: Restore original value in buffer if unmarshalled one was illegal

version 0.7.7
 - CryptSym: fix AES output IV
   A CVE has been filed for this bugfix. Unfortunately multi-step encrypted
   data won't decrypt anymore but are now compatible with other TPM 2 devices.

version 0.7.6
  - tpm2: Fix public key context save due to ANY_OBJECT_Marshal usage
    This fixes a suspend/resume problem when public keys are
    loaded
  - tpm2: Address some Coverity issues (false positives)
  - tpm1.2: Backported ASAN/UBSAN related fixes

version 0.7.5
  - Note: The TPM 2 implementation returns 2048 bit keys with ~1984 bit
          strength due to a bug in the TPM 2 key creation algo that cannot
          easily be fixed. The bug is in RsaAjustPrimeCandidate, which is
          called before the prime number check.
  - tpm2: Return properly sized array for b parameter for NIST P521 (HLK)
  - tpm2: Addressed issues detected by UBSAN
  - tpm2: Addressed issues detected by cppcheck (false positives)

version 0.7.4
  - Addressed potential constant-time related issues in TPM 1.2 and TPM 2 code
    TPM 1.2: RSA decryption
    TPM 2: EcSchnorr and EcSM2 signatures; Ecsda is handled by OpenSSL
  - Fixed some compilation issues

version 0.7.3
  - Fixed the set of PCRs belonging to the TCB group. This affects the
    pcrUpdateCounter in TPM2_Pcrread() responses, thus needs latest `swtpm`
    (master, stable branches) for test cases to succeed there.

version 0.7.2
  - Fix output buffer parameter and size for RSA decryption that could cause
    stack corruption under certain circumstances
  - Set the RSA PSS salt length to the digest length rathern than max. possible
  - Fixes to symmetric decrytion related to input size check,
    defer padding to the user [EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding(ctx, 0)] and
    to always use a temporary malloc'ed buffer for decryption

version 0.7.1
  - tpm2: Fix TDES key creation by adding missing un-/marshalling functions
  - tpm2: Fix a bug in CheckAuthSession
  - compilation fixes for TPM 1.2 & TPM 2 and various architectures and
    gcc versions
  - Fix support for NIST curves P{192,224,521} and SM2 P256 and BN P648
    that would not work;
  - Runtime filter elliptic curves (that OpenSSL does not support) and do
    not advertise those curves as capabilities
  - Removed unnecessary space in MANUFACTURER "IBM " -> "IBM"

version 0.7.0
  - use OpenSSL crypto for AES, TDES, EC, and RSA operations when possible

version 0.6.0
  - added TPM 2 support (revision 150)

  - New API calls:
    - TPMLIB_CancelCommand
    - TPMLIB_ChooseTPMVersion
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugFD
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugLevel
    - TPMLIB_SetDebugPrefix
    - TPMLIB_SetBufferSize
    - TPMLIB_ValidateState
    - TPMLIB_SetState
    - TPMLIB_GetState

version 0.5.1
  first public release

  - release 7 increased NVRAM area for being able to store more data in
    the TPM's NVRAM areas, i.e., X.509 certificates

  - release 9 added two more APIs:
    - TPM_Free
    - TPMLIB_DecodeBlob
