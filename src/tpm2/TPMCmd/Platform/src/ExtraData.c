//** _plat__GetPlatformManufactureData

// This function allows the platform to provide a small amount of data to be
// stored as part of the TPM's PERSISTENT_DATA structure during manufacture.  Of
// course the platform can store data separately as well, but this allows a
// simple platform implementation to store a few bytes of data without
// implementing a multi-layer storage system.  This function is called on
// manufacture and CLEAR.  The buffer will contain the last value provided
// to the Core library.
