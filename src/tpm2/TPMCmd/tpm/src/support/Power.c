//*** TPMInit()
// This function is used to process a power on event.

// This function registers the fact that the TPM has been initialized
// (a TPM2_Startup() has completed successfully).

//*** TPMIsStarted()
// Indicates if the TPM has been initialized (a TPM2_Startup() has completed
// successfully after a _TPM_Init).
//  Return Type: BOOL
//      TRUE(1)         TPM has been initialized
//      FALSE(0)        TPM has not been initialized
