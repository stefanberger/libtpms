//** Introduction
// The functions in this file are designed to support self-test of cryptographic
// functions in the TPM. The TPM allows the user to decide whether to run self-test
// on a demand basis or to run all the self-tests before proceeding.
//
// The self-tests are controlled by a set of bit vectors. The
// 'g_untestedDecryptionAlgorithms' vector has a bit for each decryption algorithm
// that needs to be tested and 'g_untestedEncryptionAlgorithms' has a bit for
// each encryption algorithm that needs to be tested. Before an algorithm
// is used, the appropriate vector is checked (indexed using the algorithm ID).
// If the bit is 1, then the test function should be called.
//
// For more information, see TpmSelfTests.txt

#include "Tpm.h"

//** Functions

//*** RunSelfTest()
// Local function to run self-test
static TPM_RC CryptRunSelfTests(
				ALGORITHM_VECTOR* toTest  // IN: the vector of the algorithms to test
				)
{
    TPM_ALG_ID alg;

    // For each of the algorithms that are in the toTestVecor, need to run a
    // test
    for(alg = TPM_ALG_FIRST; alg <= TPM_ALG_LAST; alg++)
	{
	    if(TEST_BIT(alg, *toTest))
		{
		    TPM_RC result = CryptTestAlgorithm(alg, toTest);
		    if(result != TPM_RC_SUCCESS)
			return result;
		}
	}
    return TPM_RC_SUCCESS;
}

//*** CryptSelfTest()
// This function is called to start/complete a full self-test.
// If 'fullTest' is NO, then only the untested algorithms will be run. If
// 'fullTest' is YES, then 'g_untestedDecryptionAlgorithms' is reinitialized and then
// all tests are run.
// This implementation of the reference design does not support processing outside
// the framework of a TPM command. As a consequence, this command does not
// complete until all tests are done. Since this can take a long time, the TPM
// will check after each test to see if the command is canceled. If so, then the
// TPM will returned TPM_RC_CANCELLED. To continue with the self-tests, call
// TPM2_SelfTest(fullTest == No) and the TPM will complete the testing.
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_CANCELED        if the command is canceled
LIB_EXPORT

    // all the tests will be run

	{
	    MemoryCopy(g_toTest, g_implementedAlgorithms, sizeof(g_toTest));
	}
    return CryptRunSelfTests(&g_toTest);
}

//*** CryptIncrementalSelfTest()
// This function is used to perform an incremental self-test. This implementation
// will perform the toTest values before returning. That is, it assumes that the
// TPM cannot perform background tasks between commands.
//
// This command may be canceled. If it is, then there is no return result.
// However, this command can be run again and the incremental progress will not
// be lost.
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_CANCELED         processing of this command was canceled
//      TPM_RC_TESTING          if toTest list is not empty
//      TPM_RC_VALUE            an algorithm in the toTest list is not implemented

//*** CryptInitializeToTest()
// This function will initialize the data structures for testing all the
// algorithms. This should not be called unless CryptAlgsSetImplemented() has
// been called
void CryptInitializeToTest(void)

    // Indicate that nothing has been tested

    // out any algorithms for which there is no test.

//*** CryptTestAlgorithm()
// Only point of contact with the actual self tests. If a self-test fails, there
// is no return and the TPM goes into failure mode.
// The call to TestAlgorithm uses an algorithm selector and a bit vector. When the
// test is run, the corresponding bit in 'toTest' and in 'g_toTest' is CLEAR. If
// 'toTest' is NULL, then only the bit in 'g_toTest' is CLEAR.
// There is a special case for the call to TestAlgorithm(). When 'alg' is
// ALG_ERROR, TestAlgorithm() will CLEAR any bit in 'toTest' for which it has
// no test. This allows the knowledge about which algorithms have test to be
// accessed through the interface that provides the test.
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_CANCELED     test was canceled
