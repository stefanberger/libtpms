// CLOCK_NOMINAL is the number of hardware ticks per mS. A value of 300000 means that the nominal
// clock rate used to drive the hardware clock is 30 MHz. The adjustment rates are used to determine
// the conversion of the hardware ticks to internal hardware clock value. In practice, we would
// expect that there would be a hardware register will accumulated mS. It would be incremented by
// the output of a pre-scaler. The pre-scaler would divide the ticks from the clock by some value
// that would compensate for the difference between clock time and real time. The code in Clock does
// the emulation of this function.
