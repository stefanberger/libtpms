//*** CryptEccSign()
// This function is the dispatch function for the various ECC-based
// signing schemes.
// There is a bit of ugliness to the parameter passing. In order to test this,
// we sometime would like to use a deterministic RNG so that we can get the same
// signatures during testing. The easiest way to do this for most schemes is to
// pass in a deterministic RNG and let it return canned values during testing.
// There is a competing need for a canned parameter to use in ECDAA. To accommodate
// both needs with minimal fuss, a special type of RAND_STATE is defined to carry
// the address of the commit value. The setup and handling of this is not very
// different for the caller than what was in previous versions of the code.
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_SCHEME            'scheme' is not supported
LIB_EXPORT TPM_RC CryptEccSign(TPMT_SIGNATURE* signature,  // OUT: signature

//*** CryptEccValidateSignature()
// This function validates an EcDsa or EcSchnorr signature.
// The point 'Qin' needs to have been validated to be on the curve of 'curveId'.
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_SIGNATURE            not a valid signature

//***CryptEccCommitCompute()
// This function performs the point multiply operations required by TPM2_Commit.
//
// If 'B' or 'M' is provided, they must be on the curve defined by 'curveId'. This
// routine does not check that they are on the curve and results are unpredictable
// if they are not.
//
// It is a fatal error if 'r' is NULL. If 'B' is not NULL, then it is a
// fatal error if 'd' is NULL or if 'K' and 'L' are both NULL.
// If 'M' is not NULL, then it is a fatal error if 'E' is NULL.
//
//  Return Type: TPM_RC
//      TPM_RC_NO_RESULT        if 'K', 'L' or 'E' was computed to be the point
