//** Introduction

// The NV memory is divided into two areas: dynamic space for user defined NV
// Indices and evict objects, and reserved space for TPM persistent and state save
// data.
//
// The entries in dynamic space are a linked list of entries. Each entry has, as its
// first field, a size. If the size field is zero, it marks the end of the
// list.
//
// An allocation of an Index or evict object may use almost all of the remaining
// NV space such that the size field will not fit. The functions that search the
// list are aware of this and will terminate the search if they either find a zero
// size or recognize that there is insufficient space for the size field.
//
// An Index allocation will contain an NV_INDEX structure. If the Index does not
// have the orderly attribute, the NV_INDEX is followed immediately by the NV data.
//
// An evict object entry contains a handle followed by an OBJECT structure. This
// results in both the Index and Evict Object having an identifying handle as the
// first field following the size field.
//
// When an Index has the orderly attribute, the data is kept in RAM. This RAM is
// saved to backing store in NV memory on any orderly shutdown. The entries in
// orderly memory are also a linked list using a size field as the first entry. As
// with the NV memory, the list is terminated by a zero size field or when the last
// entry leaves insufficient space for the terminating size field.
//
// The attributes of an orderly index are maintained in RAM memory in order to
// reduce the number of NV writes needed for orderly data. When an orderly index
// is created, an entry is made in the dynamic NV memory space that holds the Index
// authorizations (authPolicy and authValue) and the size of the data. This entry is
// only modified if the authValue  of the index is changed. The more volatile data
// of the index is kept in RAM. When an orderly Index is created or deleted, the
// RAM data is copied to NV backing store so that the image in the backing store
// matches the layout of RAM. In normal operation. The RAM data is also copied on
// any orderly shutdown. In normal operation, the only other reason for writing
// to the backing store for RAM is when a counter is first written (TPMA_NV_WRITTEN
// changes from CLEAR to SET) or when a counter "rolls over."
//
// Static space contains items that are individually modifiable. The values are in
// the 'gp' PERSISTENT_DATA structure in RAM and mapped to locations in NV.
