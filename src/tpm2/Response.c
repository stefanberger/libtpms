//** Description
// This file contains the common code for building a response header, including
// setting the size of the structure. 'command' may be NULL if result is
// not TPM_RC_SUCCESS.

#include "Tpm.h"
#include "Marshal.h"

//** BuildResponseHeader()
// Adds the response header to the response. It will update command->parameterSize
// to indicate the total size of the response.
