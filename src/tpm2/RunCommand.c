/* C.11 RunCommand.c */
/* C.11.1. Introduction */
/* This module provides the platform specific entry and fail processing. The _plat__RunCommand()
   function is used to call to ExecuteCommand() in the TPM code. This function does whatever
   processing is necessary to set up the platform in anticipation of the call to the TPM including
   settup for error processing. */
/* The _plat__Fail() function is called when there is a failure in the TPM. The TPM code will have
   set the flag to indicate that the TPM is in failure mode. This call will then recursively call
   ExecuteCommand() in order to build the failure mode response. When ExecuteCommand() returns to
   _plat__Fail(), the platform will do some platform specific operation to return to the environment
   in which the TPM is executing. For a simulator, setjmp/longjmp is used. For an OS, a system exit
   to the OS would be appropriate. */

/* C.11.3.1. _plat__RunCommand() */
/* This version of RunCommand() will set up a jum_buf and call ExecuteCommand(). If the command
   executes without failing, it will return and RunCommand() will return. If there is a failure in
   the command, then _plat__Fail() is called and it will longjump back to RunCommand() which will
   call ExecuteCommand() again. However, this time, the TPM will be in failure mode so
   ExecuteCommand() will simply build a failure response and return. */
