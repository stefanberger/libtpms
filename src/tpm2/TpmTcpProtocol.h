//** Introduction

// TPM commands are communicated as uint8_t streams on a TCP connection.  The TPM
// command protocol is enveloped with the interface protocol described in this
// file. The command is indicated by a uint32 with one of the values below.  Most
// commands take no parameters return no TPM errors.  In these cases the TPM
// interface protocol acknowledges that command processing is completed by returning
// a uint32=0. The command TPM_SIGNAL_HASH_DATA takes a uint32-prepended variable
// length byte array and the interface protocol acknowledges command completion
// with a uint32=0. Most TPM commands are enveloped using the TPM_SEND_COMMAND
// interface command. The parameters are as indicated below.  The interface layer
// also appends a UIN32=0 to the TPM response for regularity.
