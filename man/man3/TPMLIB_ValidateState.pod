=head1 NAME

TPMLIB_ValidateState  - Validate the state blobs of the TPM

=head1 LIBRARY

TPM library (libtpms, -ltpms)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<#include <libtpms/tpm_library.h>>

B<uint32_t TPMLIB_ValidateState(TPMLIB_StateType st,
                              unsigned int flags);
>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<TPMLIB_ValidateState()> function allows the caller to validate
the state blobs that the TPM would read upon B<TPMLIB_MainInit()> or
once the TPM_Startup command has been sent to it.

This function is useful for TPM state migration between possibly
different version of libtpms. Here the target libtpms needs to be
able to determine whether it can support the version of blobs that were
migrated and if this is not the case, the caller can refuse the
migration.

The B<tpmlib_state> parameter can be a logical 'or' of one or
multiple of of the following: B<TPMLIB_STATE_PERMANENT>,
B<TPMLIB_STATE_VOLATILE>, or B<TPMLIB_STATE_SAVE_STATE>.
The B<flags> parameter is currently not used and should be set to 0.

The first state blob that should be loaded is the permanent state,
since for example the volatile state requires it to be available
for validation.

This function should be called before B<TPMLIB_MainInit()> is invoked.
